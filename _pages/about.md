Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) working in the Models of Computations group headed by [Georg Zetzsche](http://zetzsche.xyz). I had my Master's degree from [Middle East Technical University Mathematics Department](https://math.metu.edu.tr) where I was advised by [Doc. Burak Kaya](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/burakk/). You can find my Master's thesis [here](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/89646/12625986.pdf). Parallel to my master's studies, I had the chance to work with [Doc. Ebru Aydin Gol](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr/people/ebru-aydin-gol/) from [METU Computer Engineering Department](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr), where I had my bachelor's degree from. Our research was a part of the research in [Cyber-Physical Systems Research Group](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr). 

I am actively curious about the intersection of mathematics and computer science. More passively, I am curious about my perception and its relationship with formal descriptions or modals. My current research is broadly around formal methods, automata theory, $\mu-$calculus and its applications on games.
