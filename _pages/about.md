Hey there! I am Stratis, 1st-year PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/). I am very fortunate to be a member of the Networks - Learning group and be advised by [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html).

Currently, I am mainly interested in algorithmic challenges arising when applying machine learning in social contexts where humans behave strategically. More generally, I enjoy using elements of Machine Learning, Optimization and Algorithmic Game Theory in real-world applications.

### Trivia
* My academic roots can be found at the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. During my undergraduate studies there, I had the chance to work with [Prof. Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on data mining and recommendation aspects of the Orienteering Problem.
* My life roots can be found at the Greek island of [Lesvos](https://www.lesvos.com/index.html).
